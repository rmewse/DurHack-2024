You have done difficult things in the past, you got this!
You are a strong and capable human!
You are worth the world, don't let anyone tell you otherwise!
Don't let an asteroid ruin your day :P 
You are deserving of respect, kindness, and understanding
You are raw-some!
You are dino-SAAAAAUUUUUUR great!
Everything you've ever wanted is sitting on the other side of fear (of dinos)!
You are loved by all of the dinosaurs!
Live, laugh, love dinos!
You have to look through the rain to see the dinos dancing in the rainbow!
You are the bravest of the brave (even braver than dinos)!
Sing like no one is listening! Dance like nobody is watching! Party like the DurHack dinos!
Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift. Thats why we call it the present from the dinos!
Keep calm and carry on partying like the DurHack dino!
Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the dinos in the stars!
If life gives you lemons, make dinosaur themed lemonade!
Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass. It's about learning to dance with the dinos in the rain!
